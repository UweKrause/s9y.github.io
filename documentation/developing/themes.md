# Themes and Smarty Templating

A theme is a collection of single template files, and must be put into the templates/ subdirectory to be available for selection your blog's "Manage Themes" admin section.

Themes can either consist of a Frontend Theme, a Backend Theme or provide both. All styling for the backend is done in a subdirectory "admin" of the theme directory.

## Smarty

Are you afraid of using PHP? Get the shivers of complexity? Don't be afraid: Serendipity uses the Smarty PHP templating system, see (http://www.smarty.net). There you can also find a complete description of how it can be used - it is very easy to lern, has a lower entry barrier that using PHP code, and generally "looks" cleaner und more understandable.

(Sidestep: You are not afraid of using PHP? See below for the "Template API", but bear in mind that Smarty is really comfortable to use and you shouldn't worry about using it. You can place custom PHP code easily in our Plugin API, or even a template's configuration file).

The general idea is easy: Templates should only contain display logic, and not perform actual algorithms. This is called "seperation of concerns". That means, Serendipity is responsible for executing codeflow and assembling variables that are passed to the output layer (Smarty). Smarty then allows a theme author/frontend developer to place those variables in any arrangement they like. They can use loops and logical "IF"-comparisons to perform some minor logic.

This means, Smarty themes are actually mostly HTML files where you can put in special commands or placeholders. Those are quite easy to learn and use:

* Variables are placed through curly brackets and the dollar sign: ```{$variable}```
* Arrays can be accessed similar to JavaScript: ```{$array.subkey}```
* ... but also simliar to PHP: ```{$array['subkey']}```
* Function calls can be executed with curly brackets: ```{myFunction param1="something" param2="something else"}```
* IF-queries can be performed: ```{if $variable == true}...{/if}```
* Loops can be performed: ```{foreach from=$array item="myvalue" key="mykey"}...{/foreach}```
* So called "modifiers" can be stacked to operate on a single variable with the "pipe" sign: ```{$variable|escape|lower}```
* Modifers can have parameters: ```{$variable|format_date:"%d.%m.%Y"}``

## Fallback templates

A frontend theme can hold multiple files in its directory and define its custom output. Serendipity contains a lot of individual template files (see below), but very often a theme can work with the default template files that are provided by Serendipity.

To make theme directories as small as possible, and as update- and futureproof as possible, we have a sophisticated scheme of fallbacks for files that are not provided by an individual theme.

Let's take the file "entries.tpl" for example. This template file is used in the frontend to display both the list of entries and the view of a single entry.

When your frontend is called and the entries.tpl file should be rendered, Serendipity checks for this file like this:

* First, check if the currently set theme (for example "my_custom_theme") has the file "entries.tpl". If yes: Use that file ```templates/my_custom_theme/entries.tpl```.
* Now check the theme's "info.txt" file and see if the theme defined an "Engine: XXX" which specifies the default fallback directory to use. By default, this directory is set to "2k11" - so this file ```templates/2k11/entries.tpl```will be returned. If "Engine: bulletproof" would be contained in the file, then ```templates/bulletproof/entries.tpl``` would be returned.
* If such a file would still not exist, the last fallback is to use ```templates/default/entries.tpl```

So make sure that you only copy over those files to your theme directory which you are really going to customize!

## Frontend Themes

The frontend theme is the collection of files that are used to show anything on the content.

The most important files of a theme are these:

### info.txt

This file is the only required file of a theme directory. It specifies the metadata of a theme. The format of this file is simple and consists of a few "Key: Value" pairs (only one line per key!)


```
Name: This is the name of your theme
Author: This is what is displayed as "author" in the backend
Date: The creation date of your theme (any format you like, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD)
Require Serendipity: [VERSION]
Backend: [BACKEND]
Engine: [ENGINE]
```

Every line except "Name:" is optional.

* ```[VERSION]``` can be replaced with the minimum version of Serendipity that is required to power your theme. Simply set the version number of your current installation where you developed a theme with.
* ```[BACKEND]``` can hold the string "Yes" if your theme also provides a backend theme. Leave out this line, if no backend is provided
* ```[ENGINE]``` can hold the string of any theme directory (i.e. "bulletproof", "2k11", "default") to specify, which fallback to use. If not provided, falls back to $serendipity['defaultTemplate'] (2k11).

### config.inc.php

This is another very central file of a theme, but it is optional. If that file is present, it is included just after Smarty is initialized by the core. This means that this file can use the whole range of Serendipity API functions and extend the Smarty framework with any custom Smarty modifiers or function you would like.

Also, this file is responsible for setting up theme options.

Please make sure that this file always contains those lines at the top:

```
<?php
if (IN_serendipity !== true) {
  die ("Don't hack!");
}
```

This ensures that the file can only be called from within the Serendipity framework, and not by outside HTTP calls.

#### Defining custom Smarty functions/modifiers

Since config.inc.php is called after the Smarty framework is initialized, you can easily access ```$serendipity['smarty']``` to register custom functions:

```
<?php
if (IN_serendipity !== true) {
    die ("Don't hack!");
}

// A smarty modifier is a PHP function that operates on the first parameter and returns content.
function serendipity_smarty_mymodifier($string) {
    return strtolower($string); 
    // Simply returns the lowercased version of a string.
}

// A smarty function can be called with parameters, and returns content.
function serendipity_smarty_myfunction($params, &$smarty) {
	return 'This function has been called with those parameteres: <pre>' . print_r($params, true) . '</pre>';
	// Simply returns a HTML statement with passed parameteres
}

$serendipity['smarty']->registerPlugin('modifier', 'mymodifier', 'serendipity_smarty_mymodifier'
$serendipity['smarty']->registerPlugin('function', 'myfunction', 'serendipity_smarty_myfunction'
```

Note that you first need to actually define your functions in the PHP scope, and then you need to use the ```$serendipity['smarty']->registerPlugin()``` call to make it available to Smarty templates.

* The first parameter to ```registerPlugin()``` defines whether to make a modifier or a function known.
* The second parameter defines how the function is called in a Smarty template: ```{$variable|mymodifier}``` or ```{myfunction param1="value"}```.
* The third parameter is the actual name of the PHP function that will be called.

Of course you can also use the other Smarty API functions to assign special variables you might need for your theme:

```
$serendipity['smarty']->assign('my_ip', $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
```

You can also influence whether the Smarty security should be disabled so that you can use {php} code tags or call any PHP modifiers:

```
$serendipity['smarty']->security = false;
```

#### Listen on Plugin Hooks

A themes's config.inc.php file can also hook into the Serendipity code flow. Usually this is done only by plugins. Offering this functionality in a theme has the benefit that a user does not require to install additional plugins to perform minor tasks. Also hooking into events like the CSS and JS generation is important for themes.

You can read more about plugin hooks here: **TODO: Link**

To make a theme hook into the "js" hook to add some javascript to the frontend, a function needs to be defined. This is done by a central function called ```serendipity_plugin_api_event_hook```:

```
if (IN_serendipity !== true) {
    die ("Don't hack!");
}

// The parameter order and default values should always look the same:
function serendipity_plugin_api_event_hook($event, &$bag, $eventData, $addData = null) {
    global $serendipity;

    switch($event) {
        case 'js':
            echo '$(document).ready(function() { console.log("Theme loaded!"); }';
		    return true;
            break;
    }
}
```

For each additional event hook the theme wants to "listen on", you can add multiple cases for those:

```
if (IN_serendipity !== true) {
    die ("Don't hack!");
}

// The parameter order and default values should always look the same:
function serendipity_plugin_api_event_hook($event, &$bag, $eventData, $addData = null) {
    global $serendipity;

    switch($event) {
        case 'js':
            echo '$(document).ready(function() { console.log("Frontend-Theme loaded!"); }';
		    return true;
            break;

        case 'js_backend':
            echo '$(document).ready(function() { console.log("Backend-Theme loaded!"); }';
		    return true;
            break;
    }
}
```

The examples above are trivial, but the usage nearly unlimited. Themes can provide any kind of plugin as internal functionality, even with complete plugin output that hooks into saving entries, offering new frontend functionality and anything else you can think of.

#### Theme Options

A theme can offer complex configuration for any kind of options. Those can be evaluated by the template files and affect anything from custom header images up to different entry listings or magazine-style themes.

The theme configuration is actually a lot like the configuration offered by plugins, from both a developer as well a user standpoint.

Theme options are defined in the config.inc.php file of a theme, and are listed in an array ```$template_config```. Each array key represents one configuration option, and each configuration option has a subset of specific keys that describe how it is configured.

The "var" type of each array indicates the name that you can later use to access a template option like this: ```{$template_option.layouttype}```.

An example (copied from the bulletproof theme):

```
$template_config = array(
   array(
		'var'           => 'infobp',
		'name'          => 'infobp',
		'type'          => 'custom',
		'custom'        => USER_STYLESHEET,
    ),
    array(
        'var'           => 'layouttype',
        'name'          => LAYOUT_TYPE,
        'type'          => 'select',
        'default'       => '3sbs',
        'select_values' => array('3sbs' => LAYOUT_SBS,
                                 '3bss' => LAYOUT_BSS,
                                 '3ssb' => LAYOUT_SSB,
                                 '2sb'  => LAYOUT_SB,
                                 '2bs'  => LAYOUT_BS,
                                 '1col' => LAYOUT_SC,
                                 '2sbf' => LAYOUT_SBF,
                                 '2bsf' => LAYOUT_BSF)
    ),
    array(
        'var'           => 'jscolumns',
        'name'          => JAVASCRIPT_COLUMNS,
        'type'          => 'boolean',
        'default'       => 'false',
    ),
    array(
        'var'           => 'addthisaccount',
        'name'          => ADDTHIS_ACCOUNT,
        'type'          => 'string',
        'default'       => '',
    ),
    array(
    	'var'			=> 'example_radio',
    	'name'          => 'An example radio button',
    	'type'          => 'radio',
    	'value'         => array('first', 'second', 'third'),
    	'desc'          => array('The first option', 'The second Option', 'The Third Option');
    	'per_row'       => 1
    )
);

```

This example defines four different configuration options. Each configuration option has a specific variable name, a title displayed for the user, an indicator of what type it is, and its available options. Those are defined by these array keys:

* **var**: Defines what variable name is later used so that you can check for it in the Smarty template files. ```'var' => 'layouttype'``` would later be accessible as ```{$template_option.layouttype}``` in the index.tpl file for example.
* **name**: This is the string that gets displayed to the user when configuring the theme option. Usually it holds a CONSTANT that is defined in a language file (see below)
* **default**: Defines the default value when the user has not yet entered his own
* **type**: Specifies, how your option shall be shown to the user. There are several types available, each of those can offer additional required array keys to the base configuration array:
  * **select**: Offers a select menu.
    * The values that are available need to be defined in a **select_values** array key (see example).
    * The size of the select field can be changed with the **select_size** array key
  * **multiselect**: Like the select menu above, but with multiselection.
  * **seperator**: Emits a simple seperator
  * **tristate**: Offers a "YES", "NO", "USE DEFAULT" radio-selection
  * **boolean**: Offers a "YES, "NO" radio-selection
  * **radio**: Offers a radio-selection. The available values need to be defined in the **value** array key, the matching descriptions in a **desc** array key. The **per_row** key defines how many radio buttons are displayed on a single row in the configuration.
  * **string**: Offers a single line input text field
  * **html**: Offers a textarea input field. Number of rows can be defined with **rows** array key. When WYSIWYG editor is enabled, this is shown a a WYSIWYG field.
  * **text**: Offers a textarea input field. Number of rows can be defined with **rows** array key. No WYSIWYG editing available.
  * **content**: Can be used to emit any kind of HTML on the configuration backend. The HTML is stored in the **default** array key. This is used for information output.
  * **custom**: Can be used to emit any kind of HTML on the configuration backend. The HTML is stored in the **default** array key. This is used to store custom values.
  * **hidden**: Can be used to store a hidden HTML input field. The value is fetched from the **value** array key.
  * **media**: Can be used to retrieve a media file location. Array keys **preview_width** and **preview_height** indicate image size.
  * **sequence**: Can be used for a re-orderable widget with multiple values. For an exmample, check out the ```serendipity_event_entryproperties``` plugin which uses this configuration item.
    **checkable**: If set to true, each ordered widget can be enabled/disabled. When set, retrieving the option later will only list those widgets that were checked. If not set, all available values will always be returned (in the order the user indicated)
    **values**: Defines an array that uses a unique key for its configuration and as the value it holds a sub-array with the key 'display' to provide the HTML output for each re-orderable widget.

(when selected) Values can be: select, tristate, boolean, radio, string, html, hidden.
  * When using the "select"

The configuration array is processed through ```ìnclude/functions_plugins_admin.inc.php```, ```serendipity_plugin_config()``` if you want to see how these arrays are checked. The output of the configuration items is done by the ```admin/plugin_config.tpl``` file (which also calls ```admin/plugin_config_item.tpl``` for each item).

##### Advanced theme options: Theme option groups

Theme options can also be put into specific groups. To do this, define an array like this in your ```config.inc.php``` file of the theme:

```
$template_config_groups = array(
    THEME_COLORSET  => array('colorset', 'layouttype', 'jscolumns'),
    THEME_HEADER    => array('custheader', 'headerimage', 'headertype')
);
```

The array key definesthe theme option group name which gets displayed for the user. The array value defines an array of defined theme options you want to have in that group. Those array values corellate with the name of the theme options that are defined in ```$template_config```.

##### Advanced theme options: Central navigation

Serendipity offers an "add-in" for each template config, if you want to offer menu items. To enable this, you need to make Serendipity recognize your custom theme options and merge them with global theme options.

This sounds more complicated that it is; simply add those lines after you have defined ```$template_config```:

```
// Setup an array to indicate which global theme options should be merged.
$template_global_config = array('navigation' => true);

// Load the current configuration of the defined theme options and parse them into a helper array
$template_loaded_config = serendipity_loadThemeOptions($template_config, $serendipity['smarty_vars']['template_option']);

// Now merge the loaded configuration with the additional global configuration:
serendipity_loadGlobalThemeOptions($template_config, $template_loaded_config, $template_global_config);
```

Currently only the **navigation** global option is supported, but there might be more in the future. Plus, plugins might provide more global theme options through the use of an event hook we placed for future compatibility.

Internally, serendipity_loadGlobalThemeOptions() simply appends a predefined set of configuration keys to the central array.

#### Internationalization

Just like plugins, you can make a theme available in multiple languages. For that, you need to define custom translation constants. Create a file like ```lang_en.inc.php``` in the theme's directory and put in the usual PHP deifnitions:

```
<?php
@define('MY_THEME_OPTION', 'This is my theme option');
?>
````

Now you need to load this language file in your theme's ```config.inc.php``` file:

```
$probelang = dirname(__FILE__) . '/' . $serendipity['charset'] . 'lang_' . $serendipity['lang'] . '.inc.php';

if (file_exists($probelang)) {
    include $probelang;
}

include dirname(__FILE__) . '/lang_en.inc.php';
```

Those lines ensure that a language file of the current user language is loaded (if it exists!), and also the english file is ALWAYS loaded as a fallback.

If you now provide a translation for german, you would add a file ```lang_de.inc.php``` with this content:

```
<?php
@define('MY_THEME_OPTION', 'Dies ist meine Theme-Option');
?>
```

and save that file also in the UTF-8 subdirectory (the base file should be encoded in ISO-8859-1). Serendipity will automatically now pick up that file.


#### Theme Sidebars

The variable ```$sidebars``` inside a ```config.inc.php``` defines an array of which sidebars a theme offers. By default Serendipity provides "left", "right" and "hidden". Themes can use this to define specific "footer" and "header" sidebars for example:

```
$serendipity['sidebars'] = array('left','right','hidden','footer','header');
```

The plugin manager interface will show one column for each of the configured sidebars, so that people can move around plugins from one to the other location.

Note that no spaces are allowed in sidebar names, and no sidebar name may be longer than 6 characters.

If you want that users are able to define their own sidebars dynamically, you can simply add a string-type theme option to your list:

```
$template_config['sidebars'] = array(
    'var'           => 'sidebars',
    'name'          => 'Which sidebars to use?',
    'type'          => 'string',
    'default'       => 'left,right,hidden',
)
```

### Specific theme files and their meaning

#### commentform.tpl

This file controls the look of your comment form where visitors can comment on your entries.

#### commentpopup.tpl

This controls the basic HTML layout of the optional comment popup window.

#### comments.tpl, trackbacks.tpl

This shows the available comments and trackbacks made to an entry.

#### comments_by_author.tpl

This controls the layout of the functionality where comments by visitors are shown.

#### content.tpl

This is a master template that holds your page content area, and depending on the page type (entries overview, entry search, archive page, ...) emits different messages.

#### entries_archives.tpl

This file holds the display of entry archives (per month / year).

#### entries_summary.tpl

This file displays the overview of entry archives (per month/year).

#### feed_*.tpl

These files hold the various RSS/Atom feed template files. Here you could add customization to those feeds.

#### index.tpl

This is the main template file that controls the general look of your page as well as HTML headers, meta tags, CSS embedding, sidebar locations etc.

#### entries.tpl

This is the main logic file and it tells Serendipity how to format your entry overview, how to loop entries, where to show commentsforms etc.

#### plugin_calendar.tpl, plugin_categories.tpl

Some plugins allow their own templating. Those files are prefixed with "plugin_" and can also come with certain plugins. Putting those files into your template directory will customize the look of that plugin within your theme. The files available by default for bundled plugins are for the Calendar and Categories sidebar plugins. You first need to enable the templating option in the configuration of those plugins, though!

#### preview_iframe.tpl

When you create a preview from within the admin interface, this file controls the basic look of the embedded iframe holding the preview. You need to adapt this file of your preview looks odd/off.

#### sidebar.tpl

This file controls how the list of sidebar plugins is displayed.

+++ config.inc.php

This master PHP file can customize options only available with PHP coding in your theme.

For a possible use of this, check these documents: ((http://www.s9y.org/78.html)(Special Smarty Templating)) and ((http://www.s9y.org/137.html)(Configuration of Theme options)).

+++ Styling the media manager

The media manager is the only part of the admin interface that is Smarty customizable.

The files for this are in the admin/ subdirectory of your theme:

#### media_choose.tpl

The main template file of the media manager popup window.

#### media_items.tpl

The display logic of the specific items in your media database overview.

#### media_pane.tpl

The header/footer area of the media database overview.

#### media_properties.tpl

The page which displays properties (keywords, exif-information etc.) of a selected image.

#### media_showitem.tpl

Used when displaying an image via the frontend of your blog to visitors.

#### media_upload.tpl

The template file for uploading a single or multiple images.

#### media_imgedit.tpl, media_imgedit_done.tpl, imgedit.css

The files responsible for "editing" an image. Currently still in development.

+++ Creating images

Inside the /img/ subdirectory of your template directory you can place a list of common images:

#### back.png

This image is used for the calendar plugin as the back arrow

#### forward.png

This image is used for the calendar plugin as the forward arrow

#### xml.gif

This image is used for indicating XML file links (like for the syndication and categories plugin)

#### cry_smile.gif, embaressed_smile.gif, omg_smile.gif, regular_smile.gif, sad_smile.gif, shades_smile.gif, teeth_smile.gif, tounge_smile.gif, wink_smile.gif

Various emoticons which are used by the /Emoticate Event Plugin/ to transform text-smilies into graphical representations. You may want to tweak those to match your template look.

To customize smilies with individual images from a theme, you can

create the file 'emoticons.inc.php' inside this template directory

and use an array like this:

[code]

   <?php

   $serendipity['custom_emoticons'] = array(

     ":'("  => serendipity_getTemplateFile('img/cry_smile.gif'),

     ':-)'  => serendipity_getTemplateFile('img/regular_smile.gif'),

     ':-O'  => serendipity_getTemplateFile('img/embaressed_smile.gif'),

     ':O'   => serendipity_getTemplateFile('img/embaressed_smile.gif'),

     ...

    );

    ?>

[/code]

This will override the default list of emoticons set inside the file plugins/serendipity_event_emoticate/serendipity_event_emoticate.php and use the ones you created for your template.

### Smarty methods
**TODO: functions_smarty.inc.php, serendipity_smarty_class.inc.php**

#### Smarty methods

#### Serendipity Smarty Layer

Serendipity uses it's own Layer on Top of Smarty to offer some backwards compatibility and default setup. This class ```Serendipity_Smarty``` is defined in **include/serendipity_smarty_class.inc.php**. It makes sure to only use the Serendipity theme directories, sets the compile directory and offers those backwards compatibility calls:

* **$serendipity['smarty']->register_function()** was previously used to register Smarty functions (it is now done by ```$serendipity['smarty']->registerPlugin('function', ...)```).
* **$serendipity['smarty']->register_modifier()** was previously used to register Smarty modifiers (it is now done by ```$serendipity['smarty']->registerPlugin('modifier', ...)```).
* **$serendipity['smarty']->assign_by_ref()** was previously used to assign Smarty variables by references (it is now done by ```$serendipity['smarty']->assignByRef()```).

On top of that, a ```Serendipity_Smarty_Security_Policy``` class constraints the security settings of Smarty. It allows only calling a set of PHP functions (isset, empty, count, sizeof, in_array, is_array, time, nl2br, class_exists) as well as using PHP functions for modifiers (sprintf, sizeof, count, rand, print_r, str_repeat, nl2br). If a theme or plugin needs to do more, it can override the security Settings of Serendipity by setting ```$serendipity['smarty']->security = false```.

## Backend themes

Serendipity provides its default backend theme inside the "2k11/admin" directory. The template files in that directory specify the complete look of the whole admin interface, and also contains workflow and logic as well as javascript libaries.

While you can completely build your own backend and customize the look of it, the core development continues based on those files. So it is your own responsibility to keep up with Serendipity development to port bugfixes and new features into your own backend theme, if you wish to change the Smarty templates.

Thus we suggest to only modify the CSS portion of the backend to adapt the look of it. An even better way to deal with a customized backend theme is to simply put a "user.css" file into the "2k11/admin/" subdirectory. Inside that CSS file you can overwrite any CSS rules, and because this file is not part of our core distribution, it will be update-safe for future Serendipity versions.

Having said this, here is a description of what each backend template does. Note that the described template-fallback mechanism of the frontend (see above) also applies to the backend.

# Linking spartacus

You can easily combine the whole spartacus theme and plugin checkouts on your machine. To do that you can for example checkout these repositories to a subdirectory like ```templates/spartacus/``` and ```plugins/spartacus/```. The reason this works is because both the theme and plugin framework of Serendipity can iterate through every subdirectory of the templates/ or plugins/ structure to search for matching plugin/theme files.


# Best practice for themes

* Make sure that you only change template files you absolutely must. Serendipity can fallback to use default template files, so if you do not need to change the 'index.tpl' file for example, please simply do not provide that file.
* If your templates needs a config.inc.php file or custom language files, please try to make those files as small as possible. Performance counts, and PHP code should only be used if the code in there is fit to be executed on each page visit. You can disable smarty security through $serendipity['smarty']->security = false - but only do this, if you absolutely must due to custom use of unregistered PHP functions or modifiers or {php} calls.
* Please try to properly indent all of your HTML and CSS rules by using 4 spaces (not tabs).
* Please try to use HTML5 or proper XHTML. HTML 4.0 should really no longer be used.
* Please try to make sure your template can be viewed in all modern browsers.
* If you provide foreign language files, also deliver the language files inside the "UTF-8" subdirectory of your template, and save them in UTF-8 encoding. Save all files using UNIX Linebreaks (\n) if possible.
