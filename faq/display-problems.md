# What kind of display problem?

Stuff looking wrong, eh?  Which most accurately represents your problem:

[The blog screen, or part of the screen, is blank.](http://www.s9y.org/152.html)

[Some images are missing.](http://www.s9y.org/158.html)

[Some elements are too close, too far, overlapping, or displaying text differently than you expected.](http://www.s9y.org/157.html)
