# Serendipity -  a PHP Weblog/Blog software

Serendipity is a PHP-powered weblog application which gives the user an easy way to maintain an online diary, weblog or even a complete homepage.  While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers a flexible, expandable and easy-to-use framework with the power for professional applications.

Casual users appreciate the way Serendipity's sophisticated **plugin architecture** allows you to easily modify both the appearance of your blog and its features. You can install more than 120 plugins with just one click, instantly enhancing your blog's functionality. **No need to edit code!**

Likewise, one click installs any of more than 80 official **templates**, so your blog looks the way you like it. And Serendipity's SPARTACUS plugin **automatically checks** the central repository for upgrades and new functionality whenever you check the list.

Advanced users value Serendipity's **Smarty templates** for combining simplicity with well-documented **web standards**. It makes minor modifications trivial, but provides the power to unleash your creativity and completely customize your site! Serendipity's *outstanding support* gives you the confidence to be adventurous, too.

Programmers and other technical users commend Serendipity for its **fast, stable, clean PHP code**.  While beginners can learn from Serendipity, advanced programmers can easily make complex modifications. Serendipity is programmed in PHP, long recognized for its ideal blend of power, simplicity, and speed. Serendipity's **BSD licensing** ensures that programmers around the world can learn from it and improve it.
