## Features

Plugins & Themes
: [![list of plugins](/img/screenshots/plugin-installation.png)](/img/screenshots/plugin-installation.png) Extending Serendipity is as simple as clicking on a button to install a plugin or theme, and the central repository Spartacus makes it easy to find the right one.

WYSIWYG, or not
: [![The Editor](/img/screenshots/03_editor.jpg)](/img/screenshots/03_editor.jpg) A graphical editor is included, though you could also use one of the common markup languages. Or just HTML.

Media Library
: [![The Library](/img/screenshots/04_media.jpg)](/img/screenshots/04_media.jpg) Serve and organize images, videos or other files directly from your blog.

Multi-User & Multi-Blog
: [![List of authors](/img/screenshots/authors.png)](/img/screenshots/authors.png) Multiple authors can write in the same blog. The permission system keeps everything controllable. Or run a shared installation with one blog per user.

Secure

Run everywhere
: [![An example hoster](/img/hoster-example.png)](/img/hoster-example.png) All is needed is a normal Hoster with PHP. As database use MySQL, Postgres or SQLite.
