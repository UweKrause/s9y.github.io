title: Serendipity -  A reliable, secure and extensible PHP blog
---
### Our mission statement:

* **Reliability** (in terms of compatibility, functionality and adaptibility)
* **Security** (our track record shows that we have dealt with the few issues swiftly)
* **Extensibility** (easy plugins, themes)
* **Ease of use** (uncomplicated, understandable interface, PHP code with a low entry barrier)

Casual users appreciate the way Serendipity's sophisticated **plugin architecture** allows you to easily modify both the appearance of your blog and its features. You can install more than 120 plugins with just one click (using the core plugin SPARTACUS), instantly enhancing your blog's functionality. **No need to edit code!**

Likewise, one click offers more than 80 official **templates**, so your blog looks the way you like it.

Advanced users value Serendipity's **Smarty templates** for combining simplicity with well-documented **web standards** and no need to learn PHP logic. It makes minor modifications trivial, but still provides the power to unleash your creativity and completely customize your site! Serendipity's *outstanding support* gives you the confidence to be adventurous, too.

Programmers and other technical users recommend Serendipity for its **fast, stable, understandable PHP code** and its **great track-record in caring about backwards-compatibility** as well as **established security and fast reactions to (few) issues found in the past**.

While beginners can learn from Serendipity, advanced programmers can easily make complex modifications. Serendipity is programmed in PHP, long recognized for its ideal blend of power, simplicity, and speed. Serendipity's **BSD licensing** ensures that programmers around the world can learn from it and improve it, and use it for any scenario they see fit.

Users of other blogging/CMS applications are already switching to Serendipity, thanks to its easy customization and outstanding support.  Corporate users are taking advantage of Serendipity's unparalleled flexibility to set up fast, simple and customized blogs.
