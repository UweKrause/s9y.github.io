  [![List of plugins](/img/screenshots/plugin-installation.png)](/img/screenshots/plugin-installation.png)
  Extending Serendipity is as simple as clicking on a button to install a plugin or theme, and the central repository [Spartacus](http://spartacus.s9y.org) makes it easy to find the right one.
* ### WYSIWYG (or not)
  [![The editor](/img/screenshots/03_editor.jpg)](/img/screenshots/03_editor.jpg) A graphical editor is included, though you could also use one of the common markup languages. Or just HTML.
* ### Media library
  [![The library](/img/screenshots/04_media.jpg)](/img/screenshots/04_media.jpg) Serve and organize images, videos or other files directly from your blog.
* ### Multi-user & multi-blog
  [![List of authors](/img/screenshots/authors.png)](/img/screenshots/authors.png) Multiple authors can write in the same blog. The permission system keeps everything controllable. Or run a shared installation with one blog per user.
* ### Secure
  [![List of security issues, 4 in 2015](/img/cve-details.png)](/img/cve-details.png) Written with care, we have a very good track record of providing a secure software. [See for yourself](http://www.cvedetails.com/product/3867/S9Y-Serendipity.html?vendor_id=2214).
* ### Run everywhere
  [![An example hoster](/img/hoster-example.png)](/img/hoster-example.png) All is needed is a normal hoster with PHP. As database use MySQL, Postgres or SQLite.
