## Documentation overview

Our documentation is separated into four sections:

* The [FAQ](/docs/faq/index.html) collects solutions to questions that get asked often.
* Deeper explanations on how to use Serendipity can be found in the [User Documentation](/docs/users/index.html).
* Developers can use the [Technical Documentation](/docs/developers/index.html) to learn how to modify all aspects of Serendipity, from developing plugins to changing Smarty templates to changing the core itself.
* Finally, [Contributing](/docs/contributing/index.html) explains how to help the project.

In all cases, don't forget that there also is [the forum](https://board.s9y.org) to get direct help from developers and other users.

If you can read German, the s9y book by our lead developer Gavin Hicking is available [as a PDF](https://github.com/s9y/Book/blob/master/serendipity.pdf?raw=true) (**German only**).
