## Contributing

You want to spread the word about Serendipity? See how you can give back to the community? Want to dive into code, create your own plugins or themes?

We are an open source project with emphasis on "open": We welcome all kinds of users and developers, we are actively demoncratically maintained and listen (a lot!) to user feedback.

### Quick links

* Our plugin and core [code is maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/s9y/). Contributions are welcome of course!
* Documentation is also maintained through GitHub and available for browsing on [docs.s9y.org](http://docs.s9y.org).
* User Support and Discussion is offered on our [Forums](http://board.s9y.org).
* Our [own blog](http://blog.s9y.org) contains news, release and security announcement
* Additional Plugins and Themes can be checked out on [spartacus.s9y.org](http://spartacus.s9y.org); they can also be easily downloaded directly from within Serendipity!
* Our old [SourceForge project page](http://sf.net/projects/php-blog) is used as a Download-Service for releases and provides a central read-only mailinglist for commits to our GitHub repository.
* Für Deutsche Benutzer: Das Serendipity-Handbuch steht als [PDF zur Verfügung](https://github.com/s9y/Book/blob/master/serendipity.pdf?raw=true) und kann auch über [GitHub/s9y/Book](https://github.com/s9y/Book) von Helfern bearbeitet werden.

### Discussion / Feature Requests

If you want to simply discuss about Serendipity, have a pet peeve, a suggestion or a specific feature in mind you don't know how to achieve? Our [forums](http://board.s9y.org) offer the exact place to go to. Most of our developers hang out there, and can give you valuable insight - given, that you take the time to properly describe what you want. Also, **please first always read the [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)](/docs/faq/index.html)** to see if your issue can be covered there.

Feature requests are not to be entered into our issue tracker on Github; we first discuss them in the forums, and when it is agreed and the specifics are clear, our developers will enter it as a issue on the tracker.

**Deutsche Benutzer**: Es gibt einen eigenständigen deutschen Bereich im Forum, wo man auch ohne englische Sprachbarriere gut mit uns kommunizieren kann. Viele unserer Entwickler sprechen Deutsch. Der englische Bereich ist jedoch für alle, die englisch sprechen, immer der bessere Platz zur Diskussion, damit keine internationalen Benutzer ausgegrenzt werden.

### Bug reports

You found a bug? Dang. We're sorry. If you can describe what happens, please head to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/Issues) and file a bug report there. When our developers fix it (which usually happens quickly), you'll get notifications. If the issue tracker looks too complicated, feel free to report bugs on our Forums. We appreciate your help!

If you found multiple bugs, please only address one single bug per issue. GitHub issues are to be reported in english language.

**Deutsche Benutzer**: nicht-englisch sprechende Benutzer können Bugs gerne im Forum melden, unsere Entwickler werden dies dann selbständig als Bugs im System eintragen.

### Security Reports, Exploits

A security issue in our code! That's a double-dang, but luckily only happens every odd year. We kindly ask you to send security reports via e-mail to our maintainer [Garvin Hicking](blog@garv.in) where we can address issues, and coordinate a responsible disclosure together with you. The Team will give proper credits for all issues reported. We usually react within 24 hours after you get in touch with us and will talk to you about further proceedings in depth.

If you prefer, you can also open a github issue about security things and provide information on how to get in touch with you. Please do not mention specifics about the issue in the public, so that a solution for the issue can be provided in benefit for all users.

### Development

You want to join efforts, and actually code something with or for Serendipity? That's great. Here's what you need:

* Get a GitHub account, clone our repository, develop your code and contribute as a pull request. If you submit multiple requests, we'll happily hand out direct repository access (if you are interested)
* Check our our [code documentation primer](/docs/developers/code-primer.html) to see what's what in the Serendipity API
* You want to **contribute a theme or plugin**? You can do that either with GitHub pull requests, or the old-fashioned way by announcing it on our Forums. We can then put your theme to our central repository (Spartacus), if you like (after we have initially checked the theme and verified it working). This also applies to plugins - our developers perform basic security checks / code reviews, and then either give feedback to improve the plugin, or simply add it to our repository. Please bear in mind that we object to having multiple plugins performing the same task, so we kindly ask you to add new features either to existing plugins where this matches, or make your plugin so unique that it rectifies being added to a central list.

### Commercial Serendipity support

Serendipity's Core Developer Garvin Hicking works at the german web-design/multimedia agency Faktor E (Bonn). His company offers [commercial support](/docs/users/hosting.html) for all needs touching Serendipity's featureset.

### We need your help!

We really need your help in improving Serendipity, and making it known to more people. Currently there's a great demand for people who:

* simply want to **report and write about Serendipity** or participate in discussions in the forums, or maybe even keep a blog about Serendipity development to inform users of what's happening in our world (plugin updates, recent forum discussions, meetings).
* want to design **new themes** or help improving the existing designs
* want to contribute and **improve our documentation**
* want to develop **new features, or new plugins**
* speak **foreign languages** and want to translate documentation or our frontend/backend. we natively support german and english languages and have a lot of basic language support, which needs updating.
* work with **QA or UX/UI**, to help us continuously improve our frontend and backend

Not only will we benefit from a larger user base, here's what you benefit from:

* Getting experience working in an open source team, having fun working on things together - and seeing how you can positively affect people around the world!
* Make an actual impact in an open source application. Serendipity is open for new ideas and offers a great place to get your word out. Unlike other huge projects, we have a flat line of hierarchy and embrace everyone's input.
* It's a great way for learning PHP, both by reading and writing code with a simple learning curve. Serendipity is easy to get into, there are no overly complex workflows like in other huge projects.
* Participation in an open source project can be a good advertisement for your future work place and your personal career

You can stay up to date with Serendipity's development by:

* Checking the [docs/NEWS](https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/blob/master/docs/NEWS) file or our repository for recent changes (or follow the [github commits](https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/commits/)).
* Reading our [blog](http://blog.s9y.org/)
* Participating in the [forums](http://www.s9y.org/forums)
