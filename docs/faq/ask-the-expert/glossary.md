* [Trackback](#A2)

### <a name="A2"></a>Trackback

A way for other blogs to let you know they're using your articles. Like a footnote, but in reverse. It is considered polite to provide a link and a trackback to any articles you reference.

Trackbacks can also be used for spam. It's annoying, but true. For more information, see
