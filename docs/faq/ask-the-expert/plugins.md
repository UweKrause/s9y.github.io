## Commonly Requested Extras

Serendipity's plugin system lets you add special capabilities to your blog with just a few mouse clicks.  If the capability you're looking for isn't on this page, check out [the SPARTACUS plugin repository](http://spartacus.s9y.org) for a complete list of plugins.

What do you want your blog to do?

* I want to hide entries from the front page. (???)
* [I want to make some entries sticky, so they always show up on top of the list.](/docs/faq/ask-the-expert/sticky-entries.html)
