### Incorrect Spacing

Now we're getting somewhere.  Could be a CSS problem, could be a plugin.  Let's narrow down our choices a bit:

Check your source using your browser's View/Source capabilities.  Are there [extra <BR/> tags](http://www.s9y.org/154.html) where the extra space occurs?

Try the default template: go to the Admin screen (log in to your blog), and choose Configure Templates.  Click on the Serendipity 3.0 template.  If it looks right in the default template, let's *broken link-->* [check for known problems in other templates.](http://www.s9y.org)
